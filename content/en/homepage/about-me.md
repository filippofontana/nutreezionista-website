#### :railway_track: My journey

I am a **nutritionist** specialized in **vegetarian** and **vegan** **nutrition**.

It's now my {{% years-till-today 2020 %}}th year as a vegan, but I stopped eating meat
{{% years-till-today 2016 %}} years ago.
This choice stems from an awareness of the **impact** that everything we put on our
plates every day has on our **health**, the **animals**, and the **environment** around us.

In 2022, I obtained my **Master's** degree in **Biology**, with a focus on **Human Health**,
from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

I am **regularly** registered at Ordine dei Biologi of Emilia-Romagna and Marche (**Section A - No. 4905**).

I furthered my training in the field of nutrition through the **Master in Vegetarian Nutrition and Dietetics**
from the Polytechnic University of Marche, which allowed me to expand my knowledge and specialize in this field.

Through this course of study, I confirmed that a **healthy** diet, in which **plant-based** foods are well-represented,
can not only reduce the risk of numerous diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases) but can also be a potential therapeutic tool.

> *My goal is to help people eat consciously, build healthy habits, and listen to their own needs, without sacrificing taste,
in a way that is sustainable for themselves, the planet, and all its inhabitants.*
