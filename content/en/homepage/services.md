#### :green_apple: First visit

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Duration**: approximately 1:00 h / 1:30 h  
:euro: **Cost**: €92

The first nutritional visit consists of an **interview** in which **eating habits** and general **lifestyle**
are explored, the presence of any **diseases**, **allergies**, or **intolerances** is assessed, and goals are defined.
The most recent **blood test** results (no older than 1 year) are also reviewed.

Next, **anthropometric parameters** are measured: weight, height, body composition analysis, and circumferences.

Following the first visit, the **personalized nutritional plan** will be sent via **email** within a few days.

#### :mag_right: Follow-Up visit

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Duration**: approximately 30 minutes

The **follow-up** visit is usually conducted about a **month** **after** the first visit and is an important
moment to **consolidate** the good habits being acquired.

**Anthropometric** parameters will be **measured** **again**, and any doubts or curiosities will be discussed
together, evaluating **any** necessary changes to the nutritional plan.

#### :green_salad: Nutritional education

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Duration**: approximately 1:00 h  
:euro: **Cost**: €82

an initial part of physiological and dietary history to understand the **eating habits**.

recipes**, **informational material**, and **personalized suggestions** for learning how to eat better will be sent.

#### :computer: Online consultations

**All** consultations can be conducted **online**, with the only difference being that **anthropometric**
parameters **cannot** be measured directly and must be **provided** by the **patient** (**weight** and **height**).
